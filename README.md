## About The Project 

This project implements a basic mobile phonebook application for a Namibian telecommunications company, focusing on efficient phonebook operations using simple linear data structures like arrays and linked lists. The application is designed to handle key operations such as:

* Inserting a contact
* Searching for a contact
* Displaying all contacts
* Deleting a contact
* Updating a contact
* (Optional) Sorting contacts for faster search
  
* Additionally, the project includes an analysis of the search algorithm's efficiency. While the application leverages basic data structures, there is room to explore more advanced techniques such as hash tables and tries.


Modules and Functions
The application is divided into the following modules, each performing specific functions:


Contact Management Module:

Insert Contact: Adds a new contact to the phonebook.
Search Contact: Searches for a contact by name.
Display All Contacts: Displays all contacts stored in the phonebook.
Delete Contact: Deletes a contact by name.
Update Contact: Updates a contactâ€™s phone number.
Sort Contacts: Sorts the contacts alphabetically by name.
File Handling Module:

Save Contacts to File: Saves all contacts to a file in CSV format.
Load Contacts from File: Loads contacts from a file and inserts them into the phonebook.
Efficiency Module:

Analyze Search Efficiency: Measures and outputs the time taken to search for a contact.
-Isaiah Mjumira



## Built With:

* Netbeans


## Usage

The usage of this mobile phonebook application is to efficiently manage and manipulate contact information. Users of the application can perform essential phonebook operations such as:

1. **Insert Contact**: Add new contacts to the phonebook, storing details such as names and phone numbers.
2. **Search Contact**: Quickly search for a specific contact by name or phone number.
3. **Display All Contacts**: View all contacts stored in the phonebook.
4. **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the phonebook.
5. **Update Contact**: Modify the details of an existing contact (e.g., updating phone numbers or names).
6. **Sort Contacts** (optional): Organize contacts alphabetically or based on other criteria for easier navigation.
7. **Analyze Search Algorithm Efficiency**: Measure and analyze the performance of the search function to understand its time complexity and optimize for better results.

This application is primarily designed for users who need a straightforward, efficient solution to manage contact information with basic functionalities, leveraging simple data structures for ease of use and implementation. It could be useful in environments where advanced database systems aren't required, such as in basic mobile systems or small-scale telecom operations.

## Modules & Funtions
The application Modules:
A modules in our context(phonebook) refers to a self-contained component of a phonebook 
application that performs a specific function related to contact management .Each 
module handles a particular task , allowing for organized and efficient management 
of contacts.Moreover each modules contributes to the overall functionality of the 
phonebook, enabling users to manage their contacts efficiently.
In our phonebook modules are: 
INSERT CONTACTS -Adds a new contact to the phonebook, ensuring that no 
duplicate entries are created and that the phonebook has space for new contacts.
SEARCH CONTACTS -Allows users to find a contact by their name and retrieve 
their phone number. DELETE CONTACTS -Removes a contact from the phonebook based on their 
name. UPDATE CONTACTS -Modifies the phone number of an existing contact.
DISPLAY ALL CONTACTS -Shows a list of all contacts currently in the 
phonebook. 
SORT CONTACTS -Arranges the contacts in alphabetical order by name to 
make searching faster
 ANALYZE EFFICIENCY -Measures how long it takes to search for a contact, 
helping to understand the performance of the search operation.
Save Contacts to File - Saves all contacts to a file for persistence. 
Load Contacts from File - Loads contacts from a file into the phonebook.
FUNCTIONS: 
Our phonebook application offers a seamless way to manage your contacts. Effortlessly add, edit, and delete entries with an intuitive interface. Enjoy advanced search capabilities to quickly find the contacts you need. Organize your contacts with customizable groups and access them anytime, anywhere. Stay connected and never lose touch with our user-friendly features designed for efficiency and convenience!
