## About The Project 

This project implements a basic mobile phonebook application for a Namibian telecommunications company, focusing on efficient phonebook operations using simple linear data structures like arrays and linked lists. The application is designed to handle key operations such as:

* Inserting a contact
* Searching for a contact
* Displaying all contacts
* Deleting a contact
* Updating a contact
* (Optional) Sorting contacts for faster search
  
* Additionally, the project includes an analysis of the search algorithm's efficiency. While the application leverages basic data structures, there is room to explore more advanced techniques such as hash tables and tries.

## Usage

The usage of this mobile phonebook application is to efficiently manage and manipulate contact information. Users of the application can perform essential phonebook operations such as:

1. **Insert Contact**: Add new contacts to the phonebook, storing details such as names and phone numbers.
2. **Search Contact**: Quickly search for a specific contact by name or phone number.
3. **Display All Contacts**: View all contacts stored in the phonebook.
4. **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the phonebook.
5. **Update Contact**: Modify the details of an existing contact (e.g., updating phone numbers or names).
6. **Sort Contacts** (optional): Organize contacts alphabetically or based on other criteria for easier navigation.
7. **Analyze Search Algorithm Efficiency**: Measure and analyze the performance of the search function to understand its time complexity and optimize for better results.

This application is primarily designed for users who need a straightforward, efficient solution to manage contact information with basic functionalities, leveraging simple data structures for ease of use and implementation. It could be useful in environments where advanced database systems aren't required, such as in basic mobile systems or small-scale telecom operations.
